git-cola v2.0.2
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Better inotify support for file creation and deletion.

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/240

* `git cola` now supports the X11 Session Management Protocol
  and remembers its state across logout/reboot.

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/164

* `git cola` has a new icon.

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/190

Packaging
---------
* Building the documentation no longer requires `asciidoc`.
  We now use `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ for building
  html documentation and man pages.

Fixes
-----
* Reworked the git-dag gravatar icon code to avoid a unicode
  error in Python 2.

* Commit message line-wrapping was made to better match the GUI editor.

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/242

* Better support for Python3 on Windows

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/246

Packaging
---------
* git-cola no longer depends on Asciidoc for building its documentation
  and man-pages.  We now depend on [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) only.
