.. _v1.4.1:

git-cola v1.4.1
===============
This feature release adds two new features directly from
`git cola`'s github issues backlog.  On the developer
front, further work was done towards modularizing the code base.

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Dragging and dropping patches invokes `git am`

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/3

* A dialog to allow opening or cloning a repository
  is presented when `git cola` is launched outside of a git repository.

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/22

* Warn when `push` is used to create a new branch

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/35

* Optimized startup time by removing several calls to `git`.


Portability
-----------
* `git cola` is once again compatible with PyQt 4.3.x.

Developer
---------
* `cola.gitcmds` was added to factor out git command-line utilities
* `cola.gitcfg` was added for interacting with `git config`
* `cola.models.browser` was added to factor out repobrowser data
* Added more tests
