git-cola v1.4.3.3
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* The `git cola` desktop launchers now prompt for a repo
  by default.  This is done by using the new `--prompt`
  flag which tells `git cola` to ignore any git repositories
  in the current directory and prompt for one instead.

Fixes
-----
* More Unicode fixes for repositories and home directories with
  embedded unicode characters.  Thanks to Christian Jann for
  patience and helpful bug reports.

* Fix the 'Clone' button in the startup dialog.
