git-cola v1.7.1.1
=================
Fixes
-----
* Further enhanced the staging/unstaging behavior in the status widget.

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/97

* Unmerged files are no longer listed as modified.

Packaging
---------
The `cola-$version` tarballs on github were originally setup to
have the same contents as the old tarballs hosted on tuxfamily.
The `make dist` target was changed to write files to a
`git-cola-$version` subdirectory and tarball.

This makes the filenames consistent for the source tarball,
the darwin .app tarball, and the win32 .exe installer.
