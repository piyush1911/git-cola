.. _v1.3.8:

git-cola v1.3.8
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Fresh and tasty SVG logos
* Added `Branch Review` mode for reviewing topic branches
* Added diff modes for diffing between tags, branches,
  or arbitrary `git diff` expressions
* The push dialog selects the current branch by default.
  This is in preparation for `git 1.7.0` where unconfigured `git push`
  will refuse to push when run without specifying the remote name
  and branch.  See the `git` release notes for more information
* Support `open` and `clone` commands on Windows
* Allow saving cola UI layouts
* Re-enabled `double-click-to-stage` for unmerged entries.
  Disabling it for unmerged items was inconsistent, though safer.
* Show diffs when navigating the status tree with the keyboard

Packaging
---------
* Worked around `pyuic4` bugs in the `setup.py` build script
* Added Mac OSX application bundles to the download page
