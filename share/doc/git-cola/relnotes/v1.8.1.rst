.. _v1.8.1:

git-cola v1.8.1
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git dag` got a big visual upgrade.

* `Ctrl+G` now launches the "Grep" tool.

* `Ctrl+D` launches difftool and `Ctrl+E` launches your editor
  when in the diff panel.

* git-cola can now be told to use an alternative language.
  For example, if the native language is German and we want git-cola to
  use English then we can create a `~/.config/git-cola/language` file with
  "en" as its contents:

  $ echo en >~/.config/git-cola/language

* Less blocking in the main UI
