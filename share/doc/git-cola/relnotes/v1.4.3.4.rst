.. _v1.4.3.4:

git-cola v1.4.3.4
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* We now provide better feedback when `git push` fails.

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/69

* The Fetch, Push, and Pull dialogs now give better feedback
  when interacting with remotes.  The dialogs are modal and
  a progress dialog is used.

Fixes
-----
* More unicode fixes, again.  It is now possible to have
  unicode branch names, repository paths, home directories, etc.
