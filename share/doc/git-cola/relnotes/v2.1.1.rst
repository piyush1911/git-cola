.. _v2.1.1:

git-cola v2.1.1
===============

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* A new "Find files" widget was added, and can be activated by
  using the `Ctrl+t` or `t` hotkeys.

* A new `git cola find` sub-command was added for finding files.

* `git cola` now remembers the text cursor's position when staging
  interactively with the keyboard.  This makes it easier to use the keyboard
  arrows to select and stage lines.

* The completion widgets will now select the top completion item
  when `Enter` or `Return` are pressed.

* You can now refresh using `F5` in addition to the existing `Ctrl+R` hotkey.

Fixes
-----
* `git cola` now passes `--no-abbrev-commit` to `git log` to override
  having `log.abbrevCommit = true` set in `.gitconfig`.
