Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------

* The icon for untracked files was adjusted to better differentiate
  between files and the "Untracked" header.

* Ctrl+O was added as a hotkey for opening repositories.

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/pull/507

* `git dag` now uses consistent edge colors across updates.

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/512

* `git cola`'s Bookmarks widget can now be used to set a "Default Repository".
  Under the hood, we set the `cola.defaultrepo` configuration variable.
  The default repository is used whenever `git cola` is launched outside of
  a Git repostiory.  When unset, or when set to a bogus value, `git cola`
  will still prompt for a repository.

* `git cola`'s Russian and Spanish translations were improved.

* `git dag` now allows selecting non-contiguous ranges in the log widget.

* `git cola` was translated to Turkish thanks to Barış ÇELİK

* The status view now supports launching `git gui blame`.  It can be
  configured to use a different command by setting `cola.blameviewer`.
