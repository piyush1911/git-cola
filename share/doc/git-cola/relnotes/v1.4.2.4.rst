.. _v1.4.2.4:

git-cola v1.4.2.4
=================
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Removed "single-click to (un)stage" in the status view.
  This is a usability improvement since we no longer perform
  different actions depending on where a row is clicked.

* Added ability to create unsigned, annotated tags.

Fixes
-----
* Updated documentation to use `cola.git` instead of `cola.gitcmd`.
