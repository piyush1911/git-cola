.. _v2.0.7:

git-cola v2.0.7
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* New hotkey: `Ctrl+Shift+M` merges branches.

* New hotkey: `Ctrl+R` refreshes the DAG viewer.

Fixes
-----
* We now use `git config` to parse the list of remotes
  instead of parsing the output of `git remote`, which
  is a Git porcelain and should not be used by scripts.

* Avoid "C++ object has been deleted" errors from PyQt4.

Packaging
---------
* The `make install` target now uses `install` instead of `cp`.
