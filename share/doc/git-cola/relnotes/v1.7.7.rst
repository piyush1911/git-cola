.. _v1.7.7:

git-cola v1.7.7
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* New and improved `grep` mode lets you instantly find and edit files.
* New `git cola grep` standalone mode.
* Support for passing arguments to the configured editors, e.g. `gvim -p`
  This makes it possible to select multiple files in the status
  window and use `Ctrl-e` to edit them all at once.
* Remote operations now prompt on errors only.
* The `Tab` key now jumps to the extended description when editing the summary.
* More shortcut key labels and misc. UX improvements.

Fixes
-----
* Selecting an item no longer copies its filename to the copy/paste buffer.
  `Ctrl-c` or the "Copy" context-menu action can be used instead.
* The repository monitoring feature on Windows learned to ignore
  changes within the ".git" directory.  Thanks to Andreas Sommer.
