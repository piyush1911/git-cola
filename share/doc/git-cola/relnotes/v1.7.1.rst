git-cola v1.7.1
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Refined the staging/unstaging behavior for code reviews.

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/97

* Added more styling and icons to menus and buttons.

* Adjusted some terminology to more closely match the git CLI.

Fixes
-----
* Boolean `git config` settings with no value are now supported
  (these are not created by git these days but exist in legacy repositories).

* Unicode branches and tags are supported in the "branch diff" tool.

* Guard against low-memory conditions and more interrupted system calls.

Packaging
---------
* Added desktop launchers for git-cola.desktop and git-dag.desktop.
  This replaces the old cola.desktop, so some adjustments to RPM .spec
  and debian/ files will be needed.

* Fixed the darwin app-tarball Makefile target to create relative paths.

Cleanup
-------
* The `--style` option was removed.  `git cola` follows the system theme
  so there's no need for this option these days.
