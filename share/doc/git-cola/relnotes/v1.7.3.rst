.. _v1.7.3:

git-cola v1.7.3
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git cola` learned a few new sub commands:

.. sourcecode:: sh

    git cola dag
    git cola branch
    git cola search

* `Return` in the summary field jumps to the extended description.

* `Ctrl+Return` is now a shortcut for 'Commit'.

* Better French translation for 'Sign-off'.

* The 'Search' widget now has a much simpler and streamlined
  user interface.

* vim-style `h,j,k,l` navigation shortcuts were added to the DAG widget.

* `git dag` no longer prompts for files when diffing commits if the
  text field contains paths.

* General user interface and performance improvements.

Fixes
-----
* The diff viewer no longer changes font size when holding `Control`
  while scrolling with the mouse wheel.

* Files with a typechange (e.g. symlinks that become files, etc.)
  are now correctly identified as being modified.

Packaging
---------
* The `cola.controllers` and `cola.views` packages were removed.
