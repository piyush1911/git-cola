.. _v1.3.7:

git-cola v1.3.7
===============
Subsystems
----------
* `git difftool` became an official git command in `git 1.6.3`.

  `difftool.prompt` configuration variable

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Warn when `non-fast-forward` is used with fetch, push or pull
* Allow `Ctrl+C` to exit cola when run from the command line

Fixes
-----
* Support Unicode font names
* Handle interrupted system calls

Developer
---------
* `PEP-8`-ified more of the cola code base
* Added more tests

Packaging
---------
* All resources are now installed into `$prefix/share/git-cola`.
