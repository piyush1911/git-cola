* The `Ctrl+P` hotkey was overloaded to both "push" and "cherry-pick",
  so "cherry-pick" was moved to `Ctrl+Shift+C`.

* Custom GUI tools with mixed-case names are now properly supported.

* "Diff Region" is now referred to as "Diff Hunk" for consistency
  with common terminology from diff/patch tools.
