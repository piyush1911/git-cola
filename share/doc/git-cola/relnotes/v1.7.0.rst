git-cola v1.7.0
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Export a patch series from `git dag` into a `patches/` directory.

* `git dag` learned to diff commits, slice history along paths, etc.

* Added instant-preview to the `git stash` widget.

* A simpler preferences editor is used to edit `git config` values.

* Improved the diff editor's copy/paste behavior

Packaging
---------
* Bumped version number to ceil(minimum git version).
  `git cola` now requires `git` >= 1.6.3.

* Simplified git-cola's versioning when building from tarballs
  outside of git.  We no longer check for a 'version' file at
  the root of the repository.  We instead keep a default version
  in `cola/version.py` and use it when `git cola`'s `.git` repository
  is not available.
