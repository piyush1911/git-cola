.. _v1.4.3:

git-cola v1.4.3
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git dag` now has a separate display area
  for displaying commit metadata.  This area will soon
  grow additional functionality such as cherry-picking,
  branching, etc.

Fixes
-----
* Fixed tests from a previous refactoring.

* Guard against 'diff.external' configuration by always
  calling 'git diff' with the '--no-ext-diff' option.

* Respect 'gui.diffcontext' so that cola's diff display
  shows the correct number of context lines.

* Raise the GUI so that it is in the foreground on OS X.

Packaging
---------
* We now allow distutils to rewrite cola's shebang line.
  This allows us to run on systems where "which python"
  is Python3k.  This is exposed by setting the `PYTHON`
  Makefile variable to the location of python2.x.

* git-cola.app is now a tiny download because it no longer
  contains Qt and PyQt.  These libraries are provided as a
  separate download.
