git-cola v1.7.5
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Auto-completion was added to more tools.

* `git dag` is easier to use on smaller displays -- the author
  field elides its text which allows for a more compact display.

* Selected commits in `git dag` were made more prominent and
  easier to see.

* 'Create Branch' learned to fetch remote branches and uses a
  background thread to do so.

* User-configured GUI tools are listed alphabetically in the 'Actions' menu.

* The 'Pull' dialog remembers the value of the 'Rebase' checkbox
  between invocations.
