.. _v1.8.2:

git-cola v1.8.2
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* We now automatically remove missing repositories from the
  "Select Repository" dialog.

  https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/issues/145

* A new `git cola diff` sub-command was added for diffing changed files.

Fixes
-----
* The inotify auto-refresh feature makes it difficult to select text in
  the "diff" editor when files are being continually modified by another
  process.  The auto-refresh causes it to lose the currently selected text,
  which is not wanted.  We now avoid this problem by saving and restoring
  the selection when refreshing the editor.

* More strings have been marked for l10n.

* Fixed the Alt+D Diffstat shortcut.

Fixes
-----
* Better error handling when cloning repositories.

  We were not handling the case where a git URL has
  no basename, e.g. `https://git.example.com/`.
  `git cola` originally rejected these URLs instead of
  allowing users to clone them.  It now allows these URLs
  when they point to valid git repositories.

  Additionally, `git cola` learned to echo the errors
  reported by `git clone` when it fails.
