git-cola v1.9.0
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* We now ship a full-featured interactive `git rebase` editor.
  The rebase todo file is edited using the `git xbase` script which
  is provided at `$prefix/share/git-cola/bin/git-xbase`.
  This script can be used standalone by setting the `$GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR`
  before running `git rebase --interactive`.

* Fixup commit messages can now be loaded from the commit message editor.

* Tool widgets can be locked in place by using the "Tools/Lock Layout"
  menu action.

* You can now push to several remotes simultaneously by selecting
  multiple remotes in the "Push" dialog.

* The `grep` tool learned to search using three different modes:
  basic regular expressions (default), extended regular expressions,
  and fixed strings.

Packaging
---------
* `git cola` now depends on the `argparse` Python module.
  This module is part of the stdlib in Python 2.7 and must
  be installed separately when using Python 2.6 and below.

Fixes
-----
* Support unicode in the output from `fetch`, `push`, and `pull`.
