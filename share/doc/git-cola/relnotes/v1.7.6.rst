git-cola v1.7.6
===============
Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* `git dag` learned to color-code branchy edges.
  The edge colors change when a new branch is detected,
  which makes the history much easier to follow.
  A huge thanks to Uri Okrent for making it happen.

* New GUI for editing remote repositories.

* New `git cola archive` and `git cola remote` sub-commands.

* `git cola browser` learned an 'Untrack' command.

* The diff editor learned to staged/unstaged while amending.

* The status tool can now scroll horizontally.

* New git repositories can be created by clicking 'New' on the
  `git cola --prompt` startup screen.
