# NUTRITIONAL FACTS


## ACTIVE INGREDIENTS

* [git](http://git-scm.com/) 1.6.3 or newer.

* [Python](http://python.org/) 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2 or newer.

* [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download) 4.4 or newer

* [argparse](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse) 1.1 or newer.
  argparse is part of the stdlib in Python 2.7; install argparse separately if
  you are running on Python 2.6.

* [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) for building the documentation.

## ADDITIVES

*git-cola* enables additional features when the following
Python modules are installed.

[send2trash](https://github.com/hsoft/send2trash) enables cross-platform
"Send to Trash" functionality.

# BREWING INSTRUCTIONS

## RUN FROM SOURCE

You don't need to install *git-cola* to run it.
Running *git-cola* from its source tree is the easiest
way to try the latest version.

    git clone git://github.com/git-cola/git-cola.git
    cd git-cola
    ./bin/git-cola
    ./bin/git-dag

Having *git-cola*'s *bin/* directory in your path allows you to run
*git cola* like a regular built-in Git command:

    # Replace "$PWD/bin" with the path to git-cola's bin/ directory
    PATH="$PWD/bin":"$PATH"
    export PATH

    git cola
    git dag

The instructions below assume that you have *git-cola* present in your
`$PATH`.  Replace "git cola" with "./bin/git-cola" as needed if you'd like to
just run it in-place.

# INSTALLATION

Normally you can just do "make install" to install *git-cola*
in your `$HOME` directory (`$HOME/bin`, `$HOME/share`, etc).
If you want to do a global install you can do

    make prefix=/usr install

There are also platform-specific installation methods.
You'll probably want to use one of these anyways since they
have a nice side-effect of installing *git-cola*'s PyQt4
and argparse dependencies.

## LINUX

Linux is it! Your distro has probably already packaged git-cola.
If not, please file a bug against your distribution ;-)

### arch

    yaourt -S git-cola

### debian, ubuntu

    apt-get install git-cola

### fedora

    dnf install git-cola

### gentoo

    emerge git-cola

### opensuse

Use the [one-click install link](http://software.opensuse.org/package/git-cola).

## MAC OS X

Before setting up homebrew, use
[pip](https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html) to install
[sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/install.html).

Sphinx is used to build the documentation.

    sudo pip install sphinx

[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) is the easiest way to install
git-cola's *Qt4* and *PyQt4* dependencies.  We will use homebrew to install
the git-cola recipe, but build our own .app bundle from source.

    brew install git-cola

Once brew has installed git-cola you can:

1. Clone git-cola

    `git clone git://github.com/git-cola/git-cola.git && cd git-cola`

2. Build the git-cola.app application bundle

    `make git-cola.app`

3. Copy it to _/Applications_

    `rm -fr /Applications/git-cola.app && cp -r git-cola.app /Applications`

## WINDOWS INSTALLATION

Download the latest stable Git, Python 2.x, and Py2x-PyQt4 installers

* [msysGit](http://msysgit.github.com/)

* [Python](http://python.org/download/)

* [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download/)

* [git-cola Installer](https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/downloads)

Once these are installed you can run *git-cola* from the Start menu or
by double-clicking on the `git-cola.pyw` script.

If you are developing *git-cola* on Windows you can use `python.exe` to run
*git-cola* directly from source.

    python.exe ./bin/git-cola

See "WINDOWS (continued)" below for more details.

# DOCUMENTATION

* [HTML documentation](https://git-cola.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

* [git-cola manual](share/doc/git-cola/git-cola.rst)

# GOODIES

*git-cola* ships with an interactive rebase editor called *git-xbase*.
*git-xbase* can be used to reorder and choose commits and is typically
launched through the *git-cola*'s "Rebase" menu.

*git-xbase* can also be launched independently of the main *git-cola* interface
by telling `git rebase` to use it as its editor:

    env GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR="$PWD/share/git-cola/bin/git-xbase" \
    git rebase -i origin/master

The quickest way to launch *git-xbase* is via the *git cola rebase*
sub-command (as well as various other sub-commands):

    git cola rebase origin/master

# COMMAND-LINE TOOLS

The *git-cola* command exposes various sub-commands that allow you to quickly
launch tools that are available from within the *git-cola* interface.
For example, `./bin/git-cola find` launches the file finder,
and `./bin/git-cola grep` launches the grep tool.

See `git cola --help-commands` for the full list of commands.

    $ git cola --help-commands
    usage: git-cola [-h]
    
                    {cola,am,archive,branch,browse,classic,config,
                     dag,diff,fetch,find,grep,merge,pull,push,
                     rebase,remote,search,stash,tag,version}
                    ...
    
    valid commands:
      {cola,am,archive,branch,browse,classic,config,
       dag,diff,fetch,find,grep,merge,pull,push,
       rebase,remote,search,stash,tag,version}

## WINDOWS (continued)

# WINDOWS-ONLY HISTORY BROWSER CONFIGURATION UPGRADE

You may need to configure your history browser if you are upgrading from an
older version of *git-cola*.

`gitk` was originally the default history browser, but `gitk` cannot be
launched as-is on Windows because `gitk` is a shell script.

If you are configured to use `gitk`, then change your configuration to
go through Git's `sh.exe` on Windows.  Similarly,we must go through
`python.exe` if we want to use `git-dag`.

If you want to use *gitk* as your history browser open the
*Preferences* screen and change the history browser command to:

    C:/Git/bin/sh.exe --login -i C:/Git/bin/gitk

Alternatively, if you'd like to use *git-dag* as your history browser, use:

    C:/Python27/python.exe C:/git-cola/bin/git-dag

*git-dag* became the default history browser on Windows in `v2.3`, so new
users should not need to configure anything.

# BUILDING WINDOWS INSTALLERS

Windows installers are built using
[Pynsist](http://pynsist.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
[NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) is also needed.

To build the installer using *Pynsist*:

1. (If building from a non-Windows platform), run
   `./contrib/win32/fetch_pyqt_windows.sh`.
   This will download a PyQt binary installer for Windows and unpack its files
   into `pynsist_pkgs/`.
2. Run `pynsist pynsist.cfg`.
   The installer will be built in `build/nsis/`.


Before *Pynsist*, installers were built using *InnoSetup*.
The *InnoSetup* scripts are still available:

    ./contrib/win32/create-installer.sh

You have to make sure that the file */share/InnoSetup/ISCC.exe* exists.
That is normally the case when you run the *msysGit bash* and not the
*Git for Windows bash* (look [here](http://msysgit.github.com/)
for the differences).
